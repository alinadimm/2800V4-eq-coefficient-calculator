# Earthquake Coefficient Calculator

This Python application calculates the earthquake coefficient (`C`) and the `K` coefficient based on the **Iranian Code of Practice for Seismic Resistant Design of Buildings (Standard No. 2800, 4th Edition)**. These coefficients are crucial for designing earthquake-resistant concrete and steel structures.

The program provides a user-friendly GUI that allows you to input parameters like soil type, lateral load resisting system, structure height, seismicity level group, and the period `Tm` calculated from structural analysis. The output coefficients can be directly used as inputs in structural analysis software like ETABS for defining earthquake load patterns.

## Features

- **GUI-based input:** Easily input required design parameters.
- **Calculations:** Provides the earthquake coefficient `C` and `K` coefficient.
- **ETABS Integration:** The output can be used as input for defining earthquake load patterns in ETABS.
